This is the repo for the paper:
Li, D., Constantinidis, C., & Murray, J. D. (2021). Trial-to-trial variability of spiking delay activity in prefrontal cortex constrains burst-coding models of working memory. Journal of Neuroscience, 41(43), 8928-8945.

The "Telegraph" folder contains theoretical characterization, simulation, and empirical analysis of the doubly stochastic Poisson spiking model.

The "Circuit models" folder contains simulation code for each one of the three circuit models used in the paper.

The "Supplementary figures" folder contains single neuron plots (such as the ones in Figure 6 of the paper) for all the analyzed neurons in the three WM tasks.
