# WorkingMemory_FF

There hold the supplementary figures of all the analyzed neurons in the manuscript "Trial-to-trial variability of spiking delay activity in prefrontal cortex constrains burst-coding models of working memory" at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.30.428962v1 

This repository is under construction. Model simulation code and data analysis scripts will be progressively cleaned and uploaded.
