# WorkingMemory_FF

There hold the supplementary figures of all the analyzed neurons in the manuscript "Trial-to-trial variability of spiking delay activity in prefrontal cortex constrains burst-coding models of working memory" published at The Journal of Neuroscience: https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/43/8928.long

This repository is under construction, and will be periodically updated over the next couple of months. Model simulation code and data analysis scripts will be progressively cleaned and uploaded.
