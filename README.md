# WorkingMemory_FF

There hold the supplementary figures of all the analyzed neurons in the manuscript "Trial-to-trial variability of spiking delay activity in prefrontal cortex constrains burst-coding models of working memory" at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.30.428962v1 

This repository is under construction, and will be periodically updated over the next couple of months. Model simulation code and data analysis scripts will be progressively cleaned and uploaded. The original code of this project was written in python 2, and I'm now refactoring and rewriting it in python 3.
